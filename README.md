## Course overview

Viral genome sequencing and sequence-dependent detection methods have been applied to the diagnosis and management of viral infections for decades. However, the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is transforming how clinical microbiology laboratories diagnose and manage infectious diseases. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of hundreds of microbes can be undertaken in hours enabling real time genomics for diagnostics, transmission investigation and infection control.

This Genomics and Clinical Virology course combines practical hands-on laboratory and bioinformatics work with faculty lectures by, and discussions with, leaders in this crucial, exciting, and expanding area. The course is aimed at virology researchers at PhD, postdoc or more senior level who have an interest in learning how to carry out NGS of viral genomes, and Clinical Scientists and Specialist Registrars who are planning to implement NGS in clinical diagnostic laboratories. The course will concentrate on the application of cutting edge genomic techniques that can be implemented now and explore new approaches that will enter practice in the near future.

The course is aimed at virology Clinical Scientists and Specialist Registrars who are planning to implement NGS in clinical diagnostic laboratories.Virology researchers at PhD, postdoc or more senior level who have an interest in learning how to carry out NGS of viral genomes are also encouraged to apply.
